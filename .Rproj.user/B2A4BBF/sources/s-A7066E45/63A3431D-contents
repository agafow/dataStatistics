Exercise 9. Standard error of the spread
Say the actual proportion of Democratic voters is P = 0.45 . In this case, the Republican party is winning by a relatively large margin of  d = -0.1, or a 10% margin of victory. What is the standard error of the spread  2x-1
 in this case?
 
 #Q
 Use the sqrt function to calculate the standard error of the spread 
2x -1.

#Answer


# `N` represents the number of people polled
N <- 25

# `p` represents the proportion of Democratic voters
p <- 0.45

# Calculate the standard error of the spread. Print this value to the console.

2*sqrt(p*(1-p)/N)
